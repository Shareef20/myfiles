                <p>it's an amazing process to get pr visa.i am naive and i hire the consultant
                    and i am happy for my decision.as a new in the market in 2017,i hesitate 
                    to take the visa consultant through VISA IMMIGRATION SERVICES,but they change
                    my preception.i am one of the its intial clients,but still,they are very 
                    professionaland show their expercise in every manner.they told me it wuold 
                    take 6 to 7 months for the canada visa and due to my poor ilets result in the 
                    first two attempts i am a little bit lait but still,they are supportive and i 
                    hope i will get my permanent residencyvisa in upcoming days.

            <p>Every organization has pros and cons,in VISAS IMMIGRATION SERVICES,I would say
                there are in the balanced side.they are trying to clear doubts in the early 
                phase of the process.for the next few months ,i must well aware with every step
                and where and when i go my pr visa.however,still,6 to 8 month will be a period
                so please prepare yourself to get into the process.alternatively,if you fail 
                to obtain the good ilets band path will be difficut in general.however,this
                is the the pair job from consultancy. if you want guidance and consulation,
